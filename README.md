## Stock Market Analysis
## Project Overview 
### <ins>Background</ins> 
By utilizing twitter sentiment analysis and linear regression, we tend to able to analyze data provided on twitter to forecast stock market closing prices.

In this project, we have applied sentiment analysis and statistical machine learning models. These models are used to envision the correlation between the tweets which are extracted from twitter. We have performed sentiment analysis of the twitter data based on a whole day as well as based on an hourly basis to analyze the effect it has on stock market prediction. 

## An overview of the process flow of our project is as follows:

### Data Collection

For this purpose, we are collectinng and normalizing stock data for the the database so it can be used in our machine learning mdodel. in order to do this, we are obtaining data microdosft excel's stock history function, cleaning the data in python using numpy and pandas and outputting it as csv files, and using postgresql to create tables for cleane CVSs for or AWS data base.  
Our data base cnfiguration has takes steps as subsequently;

#### <ins>Base Database Configuration</ins>

- Created AWS Relational Database instance.
- Configured inbound rules for connection.
- Confirmed pgSQL (pgAdmin) connection to the server. 
- Created S3 buckets to hold data. 
- Configured buckets to be publicly accessible.
- Uploaded data to buckets.
- Created Tables within Database. 
- Attempted to classify Record/Variables for Stock Data.
- Installed Apache Spark & PySpark. 
- Attempted to extract data from S3 buckets in Amazon
- Came across errors. 
- Attempted manual import of data into tables. Did not work as expected.
	- Determined tables value types causing error for import.

### <ins>Annual Returns (%)</ins>

The stock market data is collected using yfinance API and tweets are fetched from twitter using GetOldTweets API. In this step the preprocessing of the tweets such as removing stop words, hyperlink and other steps are carried out.







Sentiment Analysis: The sentiment analysis of the tweet is carried out using VADER. Here each tweet is given a sentiment score which determines if the tweet is positive, negative or neutral.
Processing: The rows which have missing values such as price values are further processed. The data along with the sentiment scores is divided into train and test data and is fed to the model.
Applying Regression Models: To predict stock Market prices, we have used Random Forest and Support vector regression models in this project. We will be then using RMSE scores to validate the efficiency of our models and to analyze which model works better for the used dataset.
I enjoyed coding in VBA immensely, owing to the ease in transfer of basic to advanced repetitive tasks. I was and am able to come back to the original or updated file in order to improve it as per my convenience at any point in time. Since, it is a standalone application - I have not had to further install any libraries / packages or applications to either update current code or run further data analysis, and it has proceeded to integrate effectively with Microsoft applications.

For your reference, within the VBA_Challenge file you can find the base code (Module 2) and the refactored code (Module 3) upon opening MIcrosoft Visual Basic Editor (Option + fn + F11 [mac users])



The project over view is to be able to obtain prediction of the stock markets's closing price using past closing prices attained from social media platforms, specifically twitter. By using twitter sentiment analysis and linear regression.

For this purpose, I used for loops, conditional formatting and statements amongst several other operators. Furthermore, on running the code and observing the run time - I refactored it such that the run-time was reduced to increase efficiency.

### <ins>Purpose</ins>
The final outcome of this data analysis pertains to Steve determining whether certain green-energy stocks are viable investments for his parents.

Quite specifically, they are looking to invest in DAQO stocks (Ticker: DQ).
According to Bloomberg: “Daqo New Energy Corporation manufactures polysilicon. The Company markets its polysilicon to photovoltaic product manufacturers who process it into ingots, wafers, cells and modules for solar power products.” (https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DQ:US)

## Building the code and Table Outputs:
Both scripts built in Module 2 (base code) and module 3 (refactored code) presented with the same output, deriving input data from the following  [dataset](VBA_Challenge.xlsm) under datasheets 2017 and 2018. Output was returned within a seperate worksheet titled **"All_Stock_Analysis"** presenting a table with three individual columns, each column referencing a different statistic (Ticker name, Total Daily Volume, and Yearly return) for the unique ticker that they relate to. The only difference, that we shall delve into the specifics of a little later down this README, being the overall efficiency in run time of the executon of each block of code.

### <ins>Ticker</ins>:
Column A holds our ticker array `Dim tickers(12) As String` holding 12 elements - one element for each of the twelve tickers being examined. Creating a  variable called `tickerIndex` allows us to recall and access array indexes as well as returning the specified values in their allocated location under the **"All_Stock_Analysis"** worksheet. 

###  <ins>Total Daily Volume</ins>:
In order to code the output for Total Daily Volume, we firstly had to specify an equation `tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) + Cells(i, 9).Value` that would allow for the calulation to be completed at least once for a single ticker before telling our script to loop it through the 11 remaining. by creating an array called tickerVolumes `Dim tickerVolumes(12) As Long`, we were consequently able to use the previously created variable `tickerIndex` to properly store correct values for each ticker within the table.

Resulting in our final line looking like `tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) = tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) + Cells(i, 9).Value`

### <ins> Yearly Return</ins>:

In order to code for **Yearly Return** the use of conditional (If-Then) statements had to be employed
```
If Cells(i - 1, 1).Value <> ticker And Cells(i, 1) = ticker Then
            tickerStartingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
            
End If

If Cells(i, 1).Value = ticker And Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> ticker Then
            tickerEndingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
            
End If
```
`tickerIndex` helps us initalze the start/end points of our loop referencing hte array of 12 previously created whereas `Dim tickerStartingPrices(12) As Single` and `Dim tickerEndingPrices(12) As Single` are variables created to store numerical values that will be called upon at a later time in our formulae to ouput the necessary results.

> Our first conditinal statemnet checks if the current row is the first row with the selected tickerIndex, this idicates the starting point of the loop.
> Our second conditional statemtn checks if the current row is the last row with the selected tickerIndex, this idicates the ending point of the loop.


#### For loops
The refactorization of our VBA code heavily depended on the basic understanding of for loops. As these loops are responsible for executing the code in a repetitive manner, in our case, increasing our tickerIndex variable by 1  `tickerIndex = tickerIndex + 1` i.e. moving up to our next ticker within the array of 12 that was previously created.

By initializing arrays `tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) = 0` we are able to set the intial volume to zero, before entering the loop again. As we will further explore in the coming sections nested for loops as presented in our base code were the source of inefficiencies. 

### <ins>Formatting </ins>
In order to present our final table in an organized and visually engaging manner, Microsoft Visual Basic Editor allows for both conditional as well as Static formatting as one would normally do within excel itself. 

Examples of sytax and various forms of user available formatting can be found [over here](https://www.excelhowto.com/macros/formatting-a-range-of-cells-in-excel-vba/). For reference purposes I have included below lines of formatting that can be visible within the code I built:

````
'makes headers Bold
    Range("A3:C3").Font.FontStyle = "Bold"
    
'Adds a border
    Range("A3:C3").Borders(xlEdgeBottom).LineStyle = xlContinuous
    
'Formats cells B4/C4 -> B15/C15 in numerical format respectively
    Range("B4:B15").NumberFormat = "#,##0"
    Range("C4:C15").NumberFormat = "0.0%"

'Auto fits all contents of any cell found in Column B
    Columns("B").AutoFit
````

An example of conditional formatting:

```
dataRowStart = 4
    dataRowEnd = 15

    For i = dataRowStart To dataRowEnd
        
        If Cells(i, 3) > 0 Then
            
            Cells(i, 3).Interior.Color = vbGreen
            
        Else
        
            Cells(i, 3).Interior.Color = vbRed
            
        End If
        
    Next i
```
By applying conditionals we can set the circumsatance in which the formatting is applied i.e. in our example above should the cells contents be greater than 0, it is colored in green otherwise it is colored in red.

### <ins>Comparison after refactoring</ins>
Table below shows main differences between code *before refactoring* and code *after refactoring* as well as their *run-time*.

The code utilizing nested loops causes back and forth switching within worksheets eating up valuable time. | Code staying within the same loop, gathers all data and stores it in arrays where then a separate for loop the results are populated in the selected worksheet making efficient use of "batch processing' to save time.

### <ins>Annual Returns (%)</ins>
The tables shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 have columns that refer to each of the 12 company’s ticker name, Total daily volume (for the given year) and Returns (Annual in Percentage).

Fig.1 i.e. for the year 2017 shows positive returns for all but 1 of the 12 companies and can be quite deceiving since Fig.2 shows that the companies unanimously had negative returns.

In conclusion, based on annual returns alone we can deduce that these are extremely volatile stocks and a very risky investment.

### <ins>Total Daily Volume</ins> 

In general, high volumes of trading daily may show that a company’s stock is doing well.

Specific to the company DQ, its stocks had a low trading volume daily in 2017 but high annual returns. But just as in the previous scenario, in 2018 we see that there has been a complete flip and the opposite can be observed with a year-end of negative 63%. 

In conclusion, DQ stocks are definitely a very risky and even dangerous investment especially if Steve’s parents were to invest all their money into these since the analysis shows how despite high trading volume the outcomes have been negligible and not worth it.

## Summary

This data analysis helped develop an understanding of refactoring of code in VBA, and led me to see the advantages versus disadvantages for the same.

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?


<ins>*Advantages*</ins>:
The main advantage and reason is to better ones’ code and improve its quality.

- Organized and Readable: The code is easy to read and understand.

- Efficient and robust: 
By improving the logic of the code, we were able to reduce the run-time for it by more than 5x and allowing for quicker programming.

- Enhanced Functionality:
Refactoring allows for the detection of bugs — especially those that may have originally been missed.

<ins>*Disadvantages*</ins>:
The following are real life disadvantages, or rather limitations owing to the refactoring of code:

- Refactoring already running code may lead to new errors or bugs creeping into the code and therefore increase time consumed with now debugging it.

- When refactoring someone else’s code one cannot always ensure prior proper documentation which may lead to time taken to understand it before refactoring it and even then may not allow for the improvement in the best possible way.

### <ins>How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script</ins>?

- I enjoyed refactoring the code since while slightly frustrating initially, in retrospect it ended up with me having a much higher quality improved code with a run-time more than 5 times faster than the original code.

- I was able to understand and deeply delve into the logic of the code as I played with the loops and operators to improve said logic.

- I cannot overlook the fact that I was able to accomplish this because of the initially well written and clearly documented code. Practically speaking, one cannot improve ‘older’ code whether ones’ own or another’s without understanding it and can ultimately end up with errors and bugs (as did I initially but that was in part due to this being one of the first times I used VBA)
